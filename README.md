# PaintCostEstimatorForRoom

This is an application that can be used to estimate the cost to paint a room. 

This application have the following:

# Methods 
– the task broken down into independent modules and methods used to implement those modules and developd the solution to application.

# Data validation 
– Validated all the information entered by the user and provided an appropriate message to the user.

# Quality 
– Followed the rules and conventions of naming a variable, method and class. Provided comments and proper organization of the code.


# Following are assumptions for application:

•	Room is a rectangular room.
•	It has one window and a door and both are rectangular.
•	Not painting the floor. The walls will be painted with the egg shell paint, roof with the flat paint and all the doors and windows with the semi-gloss paint.
•	Units of measurements for length are in inches and paint are in gallon.

# Provided the following functionality:

•	Application continues as long as the user wants.
•	It Accepts length, width, and height of the room along with the dimensions of the door and window.
•	It accepts number of hours needed to paint.
•	It also accepts the information about the paint i.e. cost per gallon, coverage area and type of paint
•	Validates all the dimensions that they are positive and room height is between 8 feet to 16 feet both inclusive.


# Implemented the following:
•	Exception handling to handle all the possible exceptional situations i.e. abnormalities like data validation
•	Created and used the following classes:
   o	Room, Door, Window, and Paint
   
 # Classes – created classes provided with appropriate associations between them and Implemented Inheritance and Composition/Aggregation
 
-	Provided the possible constructors 
-	Provided the appropriate attributes 
-	Provided the needed methods
-	Provided accessors and mutators


# Data validation – Implemented through exception handling
